# Luma Project Todos

- Setup:
    - Load configuration (luma.yml) and secrets (.luma/secrets)
    - Normalize service entries from config
    - For each target server:
        - Establish SSH connection using appropriate credentials
        - Verify Docker installation and install if needed
        - Log into Docker registry with provided credentials
        - Create dedicated Docker network for all Luma containers
        - Set up Luma Proxy and connect it to the project network
        - For each service assigned to the server:
            - Handle service-specific registry logins if needed
            - Pull latest Docker image
            - Check if container exists (running or stopped)
            - Start existing container if stopped or create new one if needed
