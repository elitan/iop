# Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you get the most out of Luma.

## Apps vs Services

Luma distinguishes between two types of deployments:

### Apps

**Apps** are your main applications that you build and deploy with zero-downtime:

- Built from your source code using Dockerfiles
- Support zero-downtime blue-green deployments
- Include automatic health checks
- Can be load balanced across multiple servers
- Have automatic SSL and reverse proxy configuration

```yaml
apps:
  web:
    image: my-app/web
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    proxy:
      hosts:
        - example.com
      app_port: 3000
    health_check:
      path: /health
```

### Services

**Services** are supporting infrastructure that use pre-built images:

- Use existing Docker images (postgres, redis, etc.)
- Deployed normally without blue-green strategy
- Focused on data persistence and supporting functionality
- Can have health checks but no automatic proxy configuration

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      secret: [POSTGRES_PASSWORD]
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## Zero-Downtime Deployments

Luma automatically provides zero-downtime deployments for apps using a blue-green deployment strategy.

### How It Works

1. **Current State**: Your app is running (let's say in "blue" state)
2. **New Deployment**: Luma deploys the new version alongside the current one ("green" state)
3. **Health Checks**: The new version is health checked to ensure it's working properly
4. **Traffic Switch**: Traffic is atomically switched from blue to green (sub-millisecond)
5. **Cleanup**: The old version (blue) is stopped and removed

### Benefits

- **No service interruption** - Users never experience downtime
- **Instant rollback** - If something goes wrong, traffic can be instantly switched back
- **Risk mitigation** - New version is fully tested before receiving traffic
- **Graceful updates** - No abrupt connection drops

### Example Flow

```bash
❯ luma deploy
[✓] Building new version (green)
[✓] Health checking green version
[✓] Switching traffic: blue → green
[✓] Stopping old version (blue)
```

## Registry-Free Operation

One of Luma's key features is that it doesn't require a Docker registry for your apps.

### Traditional Approach (with Registry)

```
Developer → Build → Push to Registry → Server pulls from Registry → Deploy
```

Problems:

- Need to set up and maintain a registry
- Network dependency on registry during deployment
- Security concerns with registry access
- Additional infrastructure cost

### Luma's Approach (Registry-Free)

```
Developer → Build → Transfer directly to Server → Deploy
```

Benefits:

- **No registry needed** - One less piece of infrastructure
- **Direct transfer** - Images go straight from your machine to servers
- **Secure** - Uses your existing SSH connection
- **Faster** - No intermediate registry step
- **Offline capable** - Works without internet once images are built

### How It Works

1. **Build locally** - Docker images are built on your development machine
2. **Save as archive** - Images are saved as tar archives using `docker save`
3. **Transfer via SSH** - Archives are securely uploaded to servers
4. **Load remotely** - Servers load images using `docker load`

```bash
# What Luma does internally:
docker build -t my-app:v1.0.0 .
docker save my-app:v1.0.0 | ssh user@server 'docker load'
```

### Services Can Still Use Registries

Services (like databases) can still pull from public or private registries:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15 # Pulled from Docker Hub

  private-service:
    image: ghcr.io/company/private:latest # Private registry
```

## Health Checks

Luma provides automatic health checking for reliable deployments.

### App Health Checks

For apps, health checks are automatic and highly opinionated for reliability:

```yaml
apps:
  web:
    health_check:
      path: /health # Only configurable option (default: /up)
```

**Automatic behavior:**

- **Method**: HTTP GET
- **Success**: HTTP 200 response
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds
- **Retries**: 3 attempts
- **Port**: Uses the configured `app_port`

### Implementation

Your app needs to implement the health check endpoint:

```javascript
// Express.js example
app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  // Check database connectivity, external services, etc.
  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

```go
// Go example
http.HandleFunc("/health", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    fmt.Fprint(w, "OK")
})
```

### Service Health Checks

For services, use Docker's standard healthcheck format:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 60s
```

## Automatic SSL and Proxy

Luma includes a built-in reverse proxy with automatic SSL certificate management.

### How It Works

1. **Traefik Proxy** - Luma deploys Traefik as the reverse proxy
2. **Automatic Discovery** - Apps are automatically discovered and routed
3. **Let's Encrypt** - SSL certificates are obtained automatically
4. **HTTP → HTTPS** - All HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS

### Configuration

Simply specify which domains should route to your app:

```yaml
apps:
  web:
    proxy:
      hosts:
        - example.com
        - www.example.com
      app_port: 3000
```

### What Happens

- `example.com` → SSL certificate obtained → routes to your app on port 3000
- `www.example.com` → SSL certificate obtained → routes to your app on port 3000
- HTTP requests → automatically redirected to HTTPS

## Multi-Server Deployments

Luma supports deploying across multiple servers for high availability and load distribution.

### Configuration

```yaml
apps:
  web:
    servers:
      - web1.example.com
      - web2.example.com
      - web3.example.com
    replicas: 2 # Deploy 2 instances per server
```

### Load Balancing

Traffic is automatically load balanced across:

- Multiple servers
- Multiple replicas per server
- Different apps on the same domain (if configured)

### Rolling Deployments

When deploying to multiple servers:

1. Deploys to servers one at a time
2. Health checks each server before moving to the next
3. If any server fails, deployment stops
4. Maintains availability throughout the process

## Release Management

Luma uses Git SHAs for release tracking and identification.

### Release IDs

Every deployment gets a unique release ID based on your Git commit:

```bash
❯ luma deploy
Using Git SHA for release ID: a1b2c3d
```

### Image Tagging

Docker images are tagged with the release ID:

```
my-app/web:a1b2c3d
my-app/api:a1b2c3d
```

### Benefits

- **Traceability** - Know exactly which code is deployed
- **Reproducibility** - Can rebuild the exact same image
- **Rollback capability** - Can identify and rollback to specific versions
- **Debugging** - Easy to correlate issues with specific deployments

## Environment Management

Luma supports multiple environments through configuration files.

### Environment-Specific Configs

```bash
luma.staging.yml     # Staging environment
luma.production.yml  # Production environment
luma.dev.yml         # Development environment
```

### Usage

```bash
luma deploy -c luma.staging.yml     # Deploy to staging
luma deploy -c luma.production.yml  # Deploy to production
```

### Benefits

- **Environment isolation** - Different servers, domains, and secrets
- **Promotion workflow** - Test in staging before production
- **Configuration drift prevention** - Environments are explicitly defined

## Security Model

Luma's security is based on SSH and existing server security practices.

### SSH-Based Security

- Uses your existing SSH keys and access
- No additional authentication required
- Leverages proven SSH security model
- Works with SSH jump hosts, bastion servers, etc.

### Secrets Management

```bash
# .luma/secrets - stored locally, never transmitted
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
API_KEY=secret-key
```

- Secrets stored locally in `.luma/secrets`
- Transmitted securely over SSH
- Available as environment variables in containers
- Never stored in logs or configuration files

### Principle of Least Privilege

- Use dedicated deployment users (not root)
- Minimal required permissions (Docker, file system)
- SSH key-based authentication only
- No persistent tokens or credentials

## Networking

Luma creates isolated Docker networks for secure communication between containers.

### Network Architecture

```
Internet → Traefik Proxy → Luma Network → Your Apps
                        → Services (Database, Cache)
```

### Automatic Service Discovery

Apps and services can communicate using their names:

```javascript
// In your app, connect to database service
const db = new Client({
  host: "postgres", // Service name from luma.yml
  port: 5432,
});
```

### Port Management

- **Automatic port assignment** - Luma handles internal port mapping
- **External ports** - Only Traefik proxy exposed (80, 443)
- **Service ports** - Optional external access for databases, etc.

Understanding these concepts will help you design and deploy robust applications with Luma. Each concept builds on the others to provide a complete, reliable deployment solution.
