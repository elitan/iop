# Quick Start

Get your first application deployed with iop in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through creating a simple web application and deploying it to your server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **A server** with SSH access (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- **Docker installed locally** for building images
- **A domain name** pointing to your server (optional, but recommended for SSL)

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize iop:

```bash
cd your-project
iop init
```

You'll be prompted for a project name, or you can use non-interactive mode:

```bash
iop init --name my-app --non-interactive
```

This creates two files:

- **`iop.yml`** - Your deployment configuration
- **`.iop/secrets`** - Secure credentials storage (automatically added to `.gitignore`)

## Step 2: Configure Your Deployment

Edit the generated `iop.yml` file:

```yaml
name: my-app

ssh:
  username: iop # or root, or your deployment user

apps:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    server: your-server.com # Replace with your server IP or domain
    environment:
      plain:
        - NODE_ENV=production
      secret:
        - DATABASE_URL # Optional: from .iop/secrets
    proxy:
      app_port: 3000 # Port your app runs on inside the container
    health_check:
      path: /up # Health check endpoint (default: /up)

# Optional: Add a database service
# services:
#   db:
#     image: postgres:17
#     server: your-server.com
#     ports:
#       - "5432:5432"
#     environment:
#       plain:
#         - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
#         - POSTGRES_DB=my-app
#       secret:
#         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
#     volumes:
#       - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### Key Configuration Options

- **`name`** - Your project name (used for Docker networks and container naming)
- **`server`** - Your server IP or domain name
- **`proxy.app_port`** - Port your application runs on inside the container
- **`build.context`** - Docker build context (usually `.`)
- **`health_check.path`** - Health check endpoint (default: `/up`)

## Step 3: Add Secrets (Optional)

If your app needs environment variables with sensitive values, add them to `.iop/secrets`:

```bash
# .iop/secrets
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/myapp
API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecret
```

**Important**: `.iop/secrets` is automatically added to your `.gitignore` file for security.

## Step 4: Prepare Your Dockerfile

Make sure you have a `Dockerfile` in your project. Here's a simple example for a Node.js app:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the app (if needed)
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Important: Health Check Endpoint

Your app **must** implement a health check endpoint. By default, iop expects `/up`:

```javascript
// Express.js example
app.get("/up", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

You can customize the health check path in `iop.yml`:

```yaml
health_check:
  path: /api/health # Custom health check endpoint
```

## Step 5: Deploy!

Deploy your application with a single command:

```bash
iop
```

That's it! iop will automatically:

1. ‚úÖ **Build your Docker image** locally
2. ‚úÖ **Set up your server** if needed (install Docker, create networks, set up proxy)
3. ‚úÖ **Transfer the image** securely via SSH (no registry required)
4. ‚úÖ **Deploy with zero downtime** using blue-green deployment
5. ‚úÖ **Configure the reverse proxy** for routing and SSL
6. ‚úÖ **Verify health checks** before switching traffic

### Example Output

```bash
‚ùØ iop
Using Git SHA for release ID: a1b2c3d
Starting deployment with release a1b2c3d

[‚úì] Configuration loaded (0ms)
[‚úì] Git status verified (3ms)
[‚úì] Infrastructure ready (1.2s)

[‚úì] Deployment completed successfully in 52.1s

Your app is live at:
  ‚îî‚îÄ https://your-server.com (web)
```

## Step 6: Verify Your Deployment

Check the status of your deployment:

```bash
iop status
```

Output:

```bash
‚ùØ iop status
üì± App: web
   Status: ‚úÖ RUNNING (green active)
   Replicas: 1/1 running
   Image: my-app/web:a1b2c3d
   Servers: your-server.com
   Last Deployed: 2 minutes ago
   Uptime: 2m 15s
   Resource Usage: CPU 2.3%, Memory 125MB

üîß Proxy Status:
   your-server.com: ‚úÖ RUNNING (port 80, 443)
   - Version: elitan/iop-proxy:latest
   - Uptime: 2m 30s
   - Active routes: 1
```

Visit your domain - it should be live with automatic HTTPS!

## What Happened Behind the Scenes?

During deployment, iop:

1. **Validated configuration** and checked git status
2. **Built your Docker image** locally using your Dockerfile
3. **Set up the server** automatically:
   - Installed Docker (if needed)
   - Created Docker networks
   - Deployed the iop reverse proxy for SSL and routing
4. **Transferred the image** securely via SSH (compressed with docker save/load)
5. **Performed zero-downtime deployment** using blue-green strategy:
   - Started new container alongside old one
   - Ran health checks on new container
   - Switched traffic atomically via network aliases
   - Removed old container
6. **Configured SSL certificates** automatically via Let's Encrypt
7. **Updated proxy routing** to direct traffic to your app

## Adding Custom Domains

To use a custom domain instead of your server IP:

1. **Point your domain** to your server's IP address
2. **Add the domain to your config**:

```yaml
apps:
  web:
    # ... other config
    proxy:
      hosts:
        - myapp.com
        - www.myapp.com
      app_port: 3000
      ssl: true # Automatic HTTPS (default: true)
```

3. **Redeploy**:

```bash
iop
```

iop will automatically:
- Obtain SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt
- Configure HTTPS redirect
- Update proxy routing

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first app deployed, explore more features:

### Multi-Server Deployment

Deploy the same app to multiple servers for load balancing:

```yaml
apps:
  web:
    # ... other config
    server: server1.com # Just change to single server per app
    # For multiple servers, deploy multiple apps:

  web-backup:
    # ... same config
    server: server2.com
```

### Add a Database Service

Add a PostgreSQL database to your deployment:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:17
    server: your-server.com
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      plain:
        - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
        - POSTGRES_DB=my-app
      secret:
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

Don't forget to add the password to `.iop/secrets`:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

### Multiple Replicas

Scale your app with multiple replicas:

```yaml
apps:
  web:
    # ... other config
    replicas: 3 # Run 3 instances for load balancing
```

### Environment-Specific Deployments

Create different config files for different environments:

```bash
# iop.staging.yml
name: my-app-staging
# ... staging config

# iop.production.yml  
name: my-app-production
# ... production config
```

Deploy to specific environments:

```bash
iop -c iop.staging.yml    # Deploy to staging
iop -c iop.production.yml # Deploy to production
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Failures

**Problem**: Docker build fails

**Solutions**:
1. Test locally: `docker build .`
2. Check your Dockerfile syntax
3. Ensure all files are included in build context
4. Use `iop --verbose` for detailed build output

### Health Check Failures

**Problem**: Deployment fails with "Health check failed"

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your app has a health check endpoint (default: `/up`)
2. Make sure the endpoint returns HTTP 200
3. Check that your app is listening on the correct port
4. Verify `app_port` in config matches your app's port

### SSH Connection Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to server

**Solutions**:
1. Test SSH manually: `ssh user@your-server.com`
2. Verify the username in `iop.yml` matches your server
3. Check firewall settings (ports 22, 80, 443 should be open)
4. Use `iop --verbose` for detailed connection info

### SSL Certificate Issues

**Problem**: HTTPS not working

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your domain points to your server IP
2. Check DNS propagation: `dig your-domain.com`
3. Verify domain is correctly configured in `proxy.hosts`
4. Wait a few minutes for certificate generation
