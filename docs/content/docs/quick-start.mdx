# Quick Start

Get your first application deployed with iop in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through creating a simple web application and deploying it to your server.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize iop:

```bash
cd your-project
iop init
```

This creates two files:

- **`iop.yml`** - Your deployment configuration
- **`.iop/secrets`** - Secure credentials storage (add to `.gitignore`)

## Step 2: Configure Your Deployment

Edit the generated `iop.yml` file:

```yaml
name: my-app

ssh:
  username: root # or your deployment user

apps:
  web:
    image: my-app/web
    servers:
      - your-server.com # Replace with your server
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    proxy:
      hosts:
        - myapp.com # Replace with your domain
      app_port: 3000
    environment:
      plain:
        - NODE_ENV=production
        - PORT=3000
      secret:
        - DATABASE_URL # Optional: from .iop/secrets
```

### Key Configuration Options

- **`name`** - Your project name
- **`servers`** - List of your server IPs or domains
- **`proxy.hosts`** - Domains that should route to your app
- **`app_port`** - Port your application runs on inside the container
- **`build.context`** - Docker build context (usually `.`)

## Step 3: Add Secrets (Optional)

If your app needs environment variables with sensitive values, add them to `.iop/secrets`:

```bash
# .iop/secrets
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/myapp
API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
```

**Important**: Add `.iop/secrets` to your `.gitignore` file!

## Step 4: Prepare Your Dockerfile

Make sure you have a `Dockerfile` in your project. Here's a simple example for a Node.js app:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the app (if needed)
RUN npm run build

# Health check endpoint
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/up || exit 1

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Health Check Endpoint

Your app should implement a health check endpoint (default: `/up`) that returns HTTP 200 when healthy:

```javascript
// Express.js example
app.get("/up", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

## Step 5: Set Up Your Server

Prepare your server for deployments:

```bash
iop setup
```

This will:

- ✅ Install Docker (if not present)
- ✅ Create necessary networks
- ✅ Set up the reverse proxy
- ✅ Configure SSL certificate automation

## Step 6: Deploy!

Deploy your application:

```bash
iop deploy
```

You'll see output like this:

```
❯ iop deploy
Using Git SHA for release ID: a1b2c3d
Starting deployment with release a1b2c3d

[✓] Configuration loaded (0ms)
[✓] Git status verified (3ms)
[✓] Infrastructure ready (1.2s)
[✓] web → my-app/web:a1b2c3d (3.3s)
[✓] Building Images (3.3s)
  └─ your-server.com
     ├─ [✓] Loading image (2.5s)
     ├─ [✓] Zero-downtime deployment (1.4s)
     └─ [✓] Configuring proxy (319ms)
[✓] Deployment completed successfully in 8.8s

Your app is live at:
  └─ https://myapp.com
```

## Step 7: Verify Your Deployment

Check the status of your deployment:

```bash
iop status
```

Output:

```
📱 App: web
   Status: ✅ RUNNING (green active)
   Replicas: 1/1 running
   Servers: your-server.com
```

Visit your domain - it should be live with automatic HTTPS!

## What Happened?

During deployment, iop:

1. **Built your Docker image** locally using your Dockerfile
2. **Transferred the image** securely to your server via SSH (no registry needed)
3. **Performed zero-downtime deployment** using blue-green strategy
4. **Configured the reverse proxy** to route traffic to your app
5. **Obtained SSL certificate** automatically via Let's Encrypt
6. **Verified health checks** before switching traffic

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first app deployed, explore more features:

- [Add a database service](/configuration#services)
- [Deploy to multiple servers](/guides/multi-server)
- [Set up multiple environments](/guides/environments)
- [Configure health checks](/configuration#health-checks)

## Common Issues

### Build Failures

If your Docker build fails:

1. **Check your Dockerfile** - Make sure it builds locally with `docker build .`
2. **Review build context** - Ensure all required files are included
3. **Check dependencies** - Verify all packages can be installed

### Connection Issues

If iop can't connect to your server:

1. **Verify SSH access** - Test with `ssh user@your-server.com`
2. **Check SSH configuration** - Ensure the username in `iop.yml` matches your server
3. **Firewall settings** - Make sure ports 22, 80, and 443 are open

### Health Check Failures

If health checks fail:

1. **Implement health endpoint** - Add `/up` route that returns 200
2. **Check app startup time** - Ensure your app starts within the timeout
3. **Verify port configuration** - Make sure `app_port` matches your app's port
