# Installation

Get Luma up and running on your system.

## Prerequisites

### Local Machine

- **Bun** or **Node.js 18+** - For running the Luma CLI
- **Git** - For version tracking and release IDs
- **Docker** (optional) - Only needed if you want to test builds locally

### Target Servers

- **Ubuntu/Debian Linux** - Luma supports Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions
- **SSH access with sudo privileges** - Luma needs to install Docker and configure services
- **Ports 80 and 443 open** - For HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- **Git** (installed automatically during setup)

## Install Luma CLI

### Using npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @elitan/luma
```

### Using Bun

```bash
bun install -g @elitan/luma
```

### Using npx (No Installation)

You can run Luma without installing it globally:

```bash
npx @elitan/luma init
npx @elitan/luma deploy
```

## Verify Installation

Check that Luma is installed correctly:

```bash
luma --help
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Luma CLI - Please provide a command.
Available commands: init, setup, deploy, status, redeploy, rollback

Flags:
  --verbose    Show detailed output
  --force      Force operation (deploy only)
  --services   Deploy services instead of apps (deploy only)
```

## Server Setup

Luma will automatically install and configure Docker on your servers when you run `luma setup`. However, you may want to prepare your servers in advance:

### Create a Deployment User (Recommended)

For better security, create a dedicated user for deployments:

```bash
# On your server
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deploy
sudo usermod -aG docker,sudo deploy

# Set up SSH key access
ssh-copy-id deploy@your-server.com
```

Then configure Luma to use this user:

```yaml
# luma.yml
ssh:
  username: deploy
```

### Manual Docker Installation (Optional)

If you prefer to install Docker manually:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

## Network Configuration

Ensure your servers have the required ports open:

- **Port 22** - SSH access for Luma
- **Port 80** - HTTP traffic (redirected to HTTPS)
- **Port 443** - HTTPS traffic
- **Custom ports** - Any ports specified in your `luma.yml` configuration

## Next Steps

With Luma installed, you're ready to:

1. [Initialize your first project](/quick-start)
2. [Configure your deployment](/configuration)
3. [Deploy your application](/commands/deploy)

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If you get `command not found` after installation:

1. **Check your PATH** - Make sure npm/bun global bin directory is in your PATH
2. **Restart your terminal** - Close and reopen your terminal
3. **Use npx** - Run `npx @elitan/luma` as an alternative

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues:

1. **Don't use sudo with npm install** - This can cause permission problems
2. **Use a Node version manager** - Consider using nvm, fnm, or volta
3. **Configure npm prefix** - Set up npm to install globally without sudo

```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```
