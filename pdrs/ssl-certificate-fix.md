# SSL Certificate Fix - Status Report

## üéâ **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

SSL certificate acquisition is now working successfully with Let's Encrypt staging mode.

**‚úÖ HTTPS is functional**: `curl -k https://test.eliasson.me` returns the app response  
**‚úÖ Let's Encrypt certificates**: Staging certificates are being issued correctly  
**‚úÖ No email required**: ACME account registration works without email  
**‚úÖ Background workers**: Process pending certificates automatically (every 1 minute)  
**‚úÖ Certificate acquisition**: Takes ~8 seconds once triggered

## Current System Behavior

### How It Works Now (WORKING)

1. **Deploy command** creates host with "pending" certificate status
2. **Background worker** runs every minute and finds pending certificates
3. **Certificate acquisition** happens automatically (takes ~8 seconds)
4. **HTTPS becomes available** immediately after acquisition

### Performance (CONFIRMED WORKING)

- **Certificate acquisition time**: ~8 seconds (ACME challenge + validation)
- **Total time to HTTPS**: ~1-5 minutes (waiting for background worker cycle)
- **Success rate**: 100% in staging mode (verified working)
- **Rate limits**: No issues with Let's Encrypt staging environment

## üîÑ **CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Immediate Certificate Acquisition (IN PROGRESS)**

**Status**: Implementation added but not working yet  
**Goal**: Certificate acquisition during deployment (~8 seconds) instead of waiting for background worker (1-5 minutes)

**What was done**:

- ‚úÖ Modified `proxy/internal/cli/cli.go` to trigger immediate certificate acquisition
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging to track certificate acquisition
- ‚úÖ Published updated Docker image with no-cache rebuild
- ‚ùå **Issue**: CLI debug logs not appearing, immediate acquisition not working

**Next steps when resuming**:

1. **Debug why CLI changes aren't taking effect** - the new debug logs should show but don't
2. **Verify the certificate manager is being called** in the deploy command
3. **Test immediate certificate acquisition** once the CLI fix is working

**Code location**: `proxy/internal/cli/cli.go` lines 81-100 (deploy function)

### 2. State Persistence Bug (MINOR)

**Current**: `luma-proxy list` shows "pending" even after successful acquisition  
**Goal**: Status should show "active" after certificate is issued

### 3. Production Mode Setup (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current**: Only tested with staging certificates  
**Goal**: Seamless switch to production certificates for live deployments

## Technical Architecture (WORKING)

### Core Components ‚úÖ

- **ACME Client**: Pure Go implementation, no external dependencies
- **Account Registration**: Works without email (Let's Encrypt compliant)
- **HTTP-01 Challenges**: Handled correctly by proxy
- **Certificate Storage**: Files saved to `/var/lib/luma-proxy/certs/`
- **State Management**: JSON-based persistence
- **Background Workers**: Process certificates every minute

### Verified Working Process ‚úÖ

```
Deploy ‚Üí Host created with "pending" cert ‚Üí Background worker (1 min) ‚Üí
ACME challenge ‚Üí Let's Encrypt validation ‚Üí Certificate issued (8 sec) ‚Üí
HTTPS available
```

## Testing Workflow (WORKING)

### Current Working Test ‚úÖ

```bash
# 1. Deploy application
bun ../../src/index.ts deploy --force --verbose

# 2. Enable staging mode (essential for testing)
ssh luma@157.180.25.101 "docker exec luma-proxy /usr/local/bin/luma-proxy set-staging --enabled true"

# 3. Wait 1-5 minutes for certificate acquisition (background worker)

# 4. Test HTTPS (ignore staging certificate warnings)
curl -k https://test.eliasson.me  # Returns: Hello World 1 ‚úÖ
```

### Target Workflow (When Immediate Acquisition Works)

```bash
# 1. Deploy application
bun ../../src/index.ts deploy --force --verbose

# 2. HTTPS should work in 8-10 seconds (immediate acquisition)
curl -k https://test.eliasson.me  # Should work immediately
```

## Success Evidence ‚úÖ

**Confirmed working certificate acquisition logs**:

```
2025/05/31 11:06:39 [CERT] [test.eliasson.me] Starting certificate acquisition
2025/05/31 11:06:39 [CERT] [test.eliasson.me] ACME challenge created: http-01
2025/05/31 11:06:40 [ACME] [test.eliasson.me] Challenge response served: 200 OK
2025/05/31 11:06:42 [CERT] [test.eliasson.me] ACME challenge validation successful
2025/05/31 11:06:47 [CERT] [test.eliasson.me] Certificate issued successfully
```

## Next Session TODO

1. **Debug CLI immediate acquisition**:

   - Check why `[CLI] Deploying host X with SSL=true` debug logs aren't appearing
   - Verify the deploy command is calling the certificate manager
   - May need to check Docker build/publish process

2. **Test immediate acquisition**:

   - Once CLI debug works, verify certificates are acquired during deployment
   - Measure time from deploy to HTTPS availability

3. **Fix state display**:
   - Update certificate status persistence after successful acquisition

---

**Summary**: SSL certificates work perfectly via background workers (1-5 min delay). Immediate acquisition code is implemented but not executing yet - needs debugging when resuming.
