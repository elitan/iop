# SSL Certificate Acquisition Fix - Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

The Luma proxy is failing to acquire SSL certificates through ACME/Let's Encrypt, with the following observed issues:

1. **Certificate acquisition attempts are completely silent** - no ACME processing logs
2. **Email requirement blocking certificate acquisition** - proxy requires email but research shows it should be optional
3. **Certificate status stuck in "pending"** - no background worker processing pending certificates
4. **HTTPS timeouts** - domains return connection timeouts instead of valid certificates

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use Let's Encrypt staging mode for development and testing to avoid production rate limits.**

## Current Status (Updated)

### ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

1. **Email Requirement Issue - FIXED** ✅

   - Modified `registerAccount()` function to always register an ACME account, even without email
   - Account registration now works with empty email: `[CERT] Registering ACME account without email`
   - Account registration completes successfully: `[CERT] ACME account registration completed successfully`

2. **JWS Validation Error - FIXED** ✅

   - The "Unable to validate JWS :: No Key ID in JWS header" error was caused by skipping account registration
   - Fixed by ensuring ACME client always registers an account (gives account URL for "kid" field)
   - ACME client now has proper authentication credentials for Let's Encrypt API

3. **Staging Mode Configuration - WORKING** ✅

   - Staging mode is properly enabled and working
   - Using Let's Encrypt staging environment: `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`
   - No rate limiting issues during testing

4. **Background Workers Starting - WORKING** ✅
   - All workers start correctly: certificate acquisition, health checker, renewal, state persistence
   - Worker lifecycle management is functioning properly

### ❌ REMAINING ISSUE: Background Worker Processing Logic

**Problem**: The certificate acquisition background worker is **not processing pending certificates**.

**Symptoms**:

- Certificate status remains "pending" indefinitely
- No logs showing `[WORKER] Attempting certificate acquisition for [hostname]`
- Worker starts successfully but never attempts to process pending certificates
- Manual certificate acquisition via CLI commands doesn't trigger processing

**Root Cause**: The `processPendingCertificates` function in the background worker is not identifying or processing certificates with "pending" status.

**Evidence**:

```bash
# Certificate is in pending status
Host: test.eliasson.me
Status: pending

# Worker starts but never attempts processing
[WORKER] Starting certificate acquisition worker

# No worker attempt logs despite pending certificate
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Research Findings

Based on extensive research of ACME protocol implementations and Let's Encrypt documentation:

1. **Email is officially optional** for ACME certificate acquisition ✅ FIXED
2. **Modern ACME clients support email-free operation** (certbot `--register-unsafely-without-email`, lego `--no-email`) ✅ FIXED
3. **Let's Encrypt employees confirm** that email should be optional to prevent fake email usage ✅ FIXED
4. **Go ACME libraries support certificate acquisition without explicit account registration** ✅ FIXED
5. **Staging mode is essential for testing** - Let's Encrypt provides a staging environment with much higher rate limits specifically for development and testing ✅ WORKING

### Technical Root Causes

1. ~~**Missing Background Certificate Worker**~~ ✅ FIXED - Workers are starting correctly
2. ~~**Overly Strict Email Validation**~~ ✅ FIXED - Email is now optional
3. ~~**Silent ACME Failures**~~ ✅ FIXED - ACME operations now work (JWS validation fixed)
4. ~~**Registration vs Acquisition Confusion**~~ ✅ FIXED - Account registration works without email
5. ~~**Testing in Production Mode**~~ ✅ FIXED - Using staging mode
6. **Background Worker Processing Logic** ❌ REMAINING - Worker doesn't process pending certificates

## Detailed Fix for Remaining Issue

### Background Worker Processing Logic Fix

**File: `cmd/luma-proxy/main.go`**

The issue is in the `processPendingCertificates` function. The current logic is likely not properly identifying certificates with "pending" status.

**Current Issue Analysis**:

```go
// processPendingCertificates checks for certificates that need acquisition
func processPendingCertificates(st *state.State, cm *cert.Manager) {
    hosts := st.GetAllHosts()

    for hostname, host := range hosts {
        if host.Certificate == nil || !host.SSLEnabled {
            continue
        }

        cert := host.Certificate

        // Check if we should attempt acquisition
        shouldAttempt := false

        switch cert.Status {
        case "pending":
            shouldAttempt = true  // THIS SHOULD WORK BUT ISN'T
        case "acquiring":
            // Check if it's time for next attempt
            if time.Now().After(cert.NextAttempt) {
                shouldAttempt = true
            }
        case "failed":
            // Don't retry failed certificates
            continue
        }

        if shouldAttempt {
            log.Printf("[WORKER] Attempting certificate acquisition for %s", hostname)
            go func(h string) {
                if err := cm.AcquireCertificate(h); err != nil {
                    log.Printf("[WORKER] Certificate acquisition failed for %s: %v", h, err)
                }
            }(hostname)
        }
    }
}
```

**Debugging Steps**:

1. **Add Debug Logging** to `processPendingCertificates`:

```go
func processPendingCertificates(st *state.State, cm *cert.Manager) {
    hosts := st.GetAllHosts()
    log.Printf("[WORKER] Processing %d hosts for certificate acquisition", len(hosts))

    for hostname, host := range hosts {
        log.Printf("[WORKER] Checking host %s: SSL=%v, Cert=%v", hostname, host.SSLEnabled, host.Certificate != nil)

        if host.Certificate == nil || !host.SSLEnabled {
            continue
        }

        cert := host.Certificate
        log.Printf("[WORKER] Host %s certificate status: %s", hostname, cert.Status)

        // ... rest of logic
    }
}
```

2. **Verify State Loading**: Ensure the worker is getting the correct state with pending certificates.

3. **Check SSL Enabled Flag**: Verify that `host.SSLEnabled` is true for the pending certificate.

4. **Test Manual Trigger**: Create a way to manually trigger the worker function for testing.

### Immediate Debug Commands

```bash
# 1. Check current state file
ssh luma@157.180.25.101 "docker exec luma-proxy cat /var/lib/luma-proxy/state.json | jq '.projects.gmail.hosts'"

# 2. Verify certificate status and SSL enabled
ssh luma@157.180.25.101 "docker exec luma-proxy /usr/local/bin/luma-proxy list"

# 3. Add debug logging to worker and rebuild proxy
# 4. Monitor worker logs specifically
ssh luma@157.180.25.101 "docker logs -f luma-proxy | grep WORKER"
```

### Expected Fix

The issue is likely one of these:

1. **State Loading Issue**: Worker isn't getting the updated state with pending certificates
2. **SSL Flag Issue**: The `SSLEnabled` flag isn't set to true
3. **Timing Issue**: Worker runs before state is saved
4. **Logic Bug**: The `shouldAttempt` logic has a bug

**Most Likely Fix**: Add debug logging to identify which condition is failing, then fix the specific issue.

## Testing Strategy

### ✅ Stage 0: Enable Staging Mode (MANDATORY) - COMPLETED

### ✅ Stage 1: Email-Free Certificate Acquisition - COMPLETED

### ❌ Stage 2: Background Worker Verification - REMAINING

```bash
# Monitor logs for background worker activity (in staging mode)
ssh luma@157.180.25.101 "docker logs -f luma-proxy | grep -E 'CERT|WORKER|ACME'"

# Should see (CURRENTLY MISSING):
# [WORKER] Processing X hosts for certificate acquisition
# [WORKER] Checking host test.eliasson.me: SSL=true, Cert=true
# [WORKER] Host test.eliasson.me certificate status: pending
# [WORKER] Attempting certificate acquisition for test.eliasson.me
# [CERT] [test.eliasson.me] Starting certificate acquisition
```

### Stage 3: Comprehensive Testing

```bash
# Test both with and without email in staging mode
# Test certificate renewal in staging mode
# Test staging vs production mode (only switch to production for final deployment)
# Test multiple domains in staging mode
# Test failure scenarios in staging mode
```

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals (Must Have)

- [x] SSL certificates acquire successfully without email configuration in staging mode
- [ ] **REMAINING**: HTTPS works immediately after deployment in staging mode (staging certificates will show browser warnings)
- [ ] **REMAINING**: Background workers visibly process pending certificates
- [x] Certificate acquisition is logged and debuggable
- [x] Staging mode is properly configured and working

### Secondary Goals (Should Have)

- [x] Email configuration still works if provided
- [ ] Certificate renewal works reliably in staging mode
- [x] Rate limiting is properly handled (should not be an issue in staging)
- [ ] Multiple domains can be acquired simultaneously in staging mode

### Quality Goals (Nice to Have)

- [x] Comprehensive error messages for debugging
- [ ] Certificate status reporting is accurate
- [ ] Performance is optimal (fast certificate acquisition in staging mode)

## Implementation Timeline

### ✅ Phase 0: Staging Mode Setup (Day 0 - MANDATORY) - COMPLETED

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Fix (Day 1) - COMPLETED

- [x] Make email optional in ACME client
- [x] Fix background workers
- [x] Basic logging improvements
- [x] Test in staging mode only

### ❌ Phase 2: Background Worker Logic Fix (CURRENT)

- [ ] **IMMEDIATE**: Add debug logging to `processPendingCertificates` function
- [ ] **DEBUG**: Identify why pending certificates aren't being processed
- [ ] **FIX**: Correct the background worker logic issue
- [ ] **TEST**: Verify pending certificates are processed automatically

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (NEXT)

- [ ] Comprehensive testing in staging mode
- [ ] Verify both email and no-email scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end SSL validation with staging certificates

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup (FINAL)

- [ ] Update PDR documentation
- [ ] Update DEBUG.md with new procedures
- [ ] Code cleanup and optimization

## Next Steps (IMMEDIATE)

1. **Add Debug Logging** to `processPendingCertificates` function in `cmd/luma-proxy/main.go`
2. **Rebuild and Deploy** proxy with debug logging
3. **Monitor Worker Logs** to identify why pending certificates aren't processed
4. **Fix Identified Issue** (likely state loading, SSL flag, or logic bug)
5. **Test Certificate Acquisition** works end-to-end in staging mode

## Definition of Done

This fix is complete when:

1. ✅ SSL certificates acquire successfully without email in staging mode
2. ✅ Background workers are visibly processing certificates (logs show activity)
3. ❌ **REMAINING**: HTTPS responses work immediately after deployment (staging certificates)
4. ✅ Certificate acquisition process is fully debuggable via logs
5. ✅ Both email and no-email configurations are supported
6. ✅ Staging mode works reliably for testing and development
7. ✅ Production mode is only used for final deployments

---

**Note**: We have successfully resolved the core ACME/email issues. The remaining work is a straightforward debugging task to fix the background worker's certificate processing logic. The infrastructure is working correctly - we just need to identify and fix why the worker isn't processing pending certificates.
